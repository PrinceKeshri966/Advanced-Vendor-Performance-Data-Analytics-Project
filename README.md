Project Goals
To develop strong job readiness through hands-on experience in data analytics.
To build a portfolio that effectively showcases practical skills to recruiters.
To integrate SQL, Python, and Power BI in addressing business challenges and enhancing data accessibility.
Technologies Used
SQL for data manipulation and analysis.
Python for data processing, automation, and exploratory analysis.
Power BI for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
Project Workflow
Data Exploration and Cleaning: The project starts with exploring raw data, cleaning it, and transforming CSV data into a structured database format using SQLite.
Data Aggregation: An aggregated table is created to simplify analysis and reduce complexity.
Data Ingestion: A function is developed for automated data ingestion from CSV files into the database.
Vendor Performance Analysis: The project investigates vendor performance through SQL queries and data summation.
Key Features and Insights
Vendor Performance Metrics: Evaluation of purchase prices, sales, inventory management, and overall vendor efficiency.
Cost Analysis: Identification of pricing strategies based on purchase quantities and vendor contributions.
Inventory Turnover Analysis: Analysis of unsold inventory value to identify vendors with low turnover.
Visualization
Data is visualized using various plots and charts in Power BI, including bar plots, funnel charts, and donut charts.
Key metrics like total sales, gross profits, and vendor contributions are highlighted to allow stakeholders to make informed decisions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed EDA to identify relationships between variables and uncover data patterns.
Used distribution plots to visualize numerical data distributions and identify outliers in vendor performance metrics.
Correlation analysis reveals relationships between purchase prices, sales revenue, quantity, and profit margins.
Dashboard Creation
Created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard presenting key performance metrics.
Filters are applied to focus on relevant records to enhance the dashboard's effectiveness.
Future Enhancements
Explore potential automation features in data reporting and visualization.
Expand data sources to include real-time analytics for more dynamic insights.
Consider integrating machine learning techniques for predictive analytics in vendor performance.
